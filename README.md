### Project 1

The first assignemnt consists of two sections. The first section focuses on term-based matching, including text preprocessing,  standard IR methods (TF-IDF, BM25, QL) implementations, and IR methods evaluation. The second section focuses on semantic-based matching, including implementing vector-space retrieval methods (LSI, LDA, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec).

### Project 2

The second assigment is about building Offline & Online Learning to Rank (LTR). The former includes implementing pointwise, pairwise and listwise algorithms. The latter includes to implement LTR algorithms from historical clicks, probabilistic multileaving, and online evaluation.
